What is JIT

Just-In-Time is also known as Dynamic Translation, is a compilation done during execution of program than prior to execution. 
Most often this is consists of translation to machime code which is then executed directly but can also refer to translation to another format.
A system implementing a jit compiler typically continuously anslyses the code being and identifies part of code where the speedup gained from 
compilation would overweigh the overhead of compiling that code.Source code is compiled into byte code when we use the java complier.
The byte code gets saved on the disk with file extension .class.When the program is to be run the byte is converted,using the JIT compiler 
JITcompilation is a combination of the two traditional approaches to translation to machine code-ahead-of-the time(AOT) and interpretation
and combines some advantages and drawbacks both.JIT causes a slight delay to a notciable delay in intial execution of an appilcation,due 
to the time taken to load and compile the bytecode.Sometimes this delay is caleed "startup time delay". In general the more optimization JIT 
performs,better the code it will generate,but the initial delay will increase. A JIT complier therefore has to make a tradeoff between the
 compliation time and the quality of the code it hopes to generate.However it seems that much of the startup time is sometimes due to IO bound
operations rather than JIT compilation. There also exist Java implementations thta combine an AOT compiler witheither a JIT complier or interpreter
